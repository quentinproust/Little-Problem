# Welcome to the LittleProblem project.
LittleProblem started as a school project where we had to study some technology we didn't knew. We made the choice to work on some interesting technos : 

* ASP.NET MVC as we did'nt had the time to learn it yet.
* OpenId because I don't understand the need every webapp has to make me create a new login/password everytime.
* MongoDB to understand the beauty behind NoSQL dataabases.
